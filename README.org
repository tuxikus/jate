* jate - just another text editor
I started this project to learn something about text editors, terminals and the programming language go. The
base of the editor is kilo.c, a small terminal text editor written by [[https://antirez.com/news/108][antirez]]. To learn more about
the kilo editor I recommend Paige Ruten's [[https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/][tutorial]].
